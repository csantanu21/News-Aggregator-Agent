I want to build a gen ai news news aggregator agent that aggregates information from different sources including youtube, and blogpost from openai, anthropic, huggingface etc. It will scrape information from the blogposts and put them in a database, including sources, article, dates, author and summary. Then it will run a rummary across all the articles using LLM, identify only the new ones from previou session, and email it to my personal email in a predefined cadence. The ummary will have snippent of each news with link to original source. For youtube I want to create a list of channels, and get the latest videos from those channels. We may use youtube access feed for that. for blogpost we can simply use the urls scraped. I want to build it using python backend, a postgress sql, preferably sql alchemy to define the database. and create database. I want the priject structure to be in app folder where all the app logic is in and wand to create a docker folder where we create the minimal set up for the postgress sql database. I want to be able to easlity deploy the app in render and also schedule the email.
